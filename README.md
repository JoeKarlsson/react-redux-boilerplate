A boilerplate for playing around with react, redux and react-router with the help of webpack.

The [deployed boilerplate](https://react-redux-boilerplate1.herokuapp.com/) can be found here.


## Introduction

The JavaScript ecosystem evolves at incredible speed: staying current can feel
overwhelming. So, instead of you having to stay on top of every new tool,
feature and technique to hit the headlines, this project aims to lighten the
load by providing a curated baseline of the most valuable ones.

Using React Boilerplate, you get to start your app with our community's current
ideas on what represents optimal developer experience, best practice, most
efficient tooling and cleanest project structure.


### Contains:

* a working example of a filterable table which you can play around with (look below).
* ES6 - 7 Support with Babel
* Redux dev tools to help you keep track of the app's state
* Routing
* hot module replacement support so you can change modules or react components without having to reload the browser
* a webpack production config so you can build the app and make it ready for production
* Sass support, just import your styles wherever you need them
* eslint to keep your js readable
* much more...


### Getting Started

* run `npm install && npm start`

### Deployment

* Add the project to Coveralls and travis-ci then link up the project to Heroku. Be sure to enable auto deployments through Travis when running this project.
